# Package Deps Info

## Why?

Only because [BundlePhobia](https://bundlephobia.com/) doesn't snow the actual list of dependencies, but it does great job of ESM Scanning and import cost stats.

Also, I needed the online version. For CLI usage, you can probably use [npm view](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-view) command.
